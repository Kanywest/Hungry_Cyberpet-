# Hungry_Cyberpet
A Hungry Cyber pet the frog preys on the fly, once the hungry button is clicked it follows the fly in random directions.
This uses threads and requires images to be added into a folder.
It implemenents JPanels, labels and buttons showing how the java.awt API works.
Other features such as the cat and mouse, eating the fly can also be implemented as the code is already in there.
A combo box can be added. 
Good start up code.
